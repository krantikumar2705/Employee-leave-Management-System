# Employee Leave Management System – Business Analyst Case Study

This project is a practical Business Analysis case study demonstrating how I document requirements, create user stories, design process flows, and structure system specifications for a simple Employee Leave Management System.  
It is created using BA best practices and tools such as Jira, Draw.io, and Figma.
